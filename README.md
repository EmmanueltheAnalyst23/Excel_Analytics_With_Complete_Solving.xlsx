 E-Commerce Sales Analysis

This project showcases my ability to work with real-world business data using Excel and SQL â€” demonstrating both analytical thinking and technical skills.

- Excel Analysis: Cleaned and structured data, used formulas (IF, SUMIFS, VLOOKUP) to calculate revenue, profit, and profit margin, and answered key business questions.
- SQL Knowledge: Wrote CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO commands to simulate relational data structure.

> Note: The SQL file is independent and included to demonstrate understanding of database setup. The full analysis was performed in Excel.
