E-Commerce Sales Analysis

This project highlights my ability to analyze business data using both Excel and SQL. It focuses on key performance metrics like revenue, profit, and margins, and demonstrates how SQL can be used to structure and manage related datasets behind the scenes.

Excel Analysis:
	•	Cleaned and organized raw sales data for clear reporting
	•	Applied formulas like IF, SUMIFS, and VLOOKUP to calculate financial metrics
	•	Answered specific business questions using logic-driven Excel models

SQL Work:
	•	Created tables and inserted sample data to simulate a database environment
	•	Demonstrated how structured data in SQL supports and feeds Excel-based analysis

Note: The main analysis and reporting were done in Excel, while the SQL component is included to show my understanding of relational databases and how they connect to front-end tools like Excel.
