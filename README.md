# E-commerce Sales Analysis (Excel + SQL Project)

This project showcases my skills in Excel and SQL through a full e-commerce sales case study.

It includes real-life solving such as revenue, profit, and profit margin calculations, with all working clearly shown using Excel formulas and SQL structure.

---

## Tools Used
- Excel (formulas, calculations, insights)
- SQL (table creation, insert statements, backend logic)

---

## Files Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
`Excel_Analytics_With_Complete_Solving.xlsx` | Full Excel solving with formulas, structure, and explanations  
`Full_Solving_SQL_Script.sql` | SQL script including table creation, insert statements, profit, revenue, and margin  

---

## Calculations Performed

- Revenue = Units Sold × Unit Price  
- Profit = (Unit Price – Cost Price) × Units Sold  
- Profit Margin = (Profit per unit ÷ Unit Price) × 100  

---

## Business Questions Answered

- What products and categories generate the most revenue?
- Which regions bring the highest profits?
- What are the monthly sales patterns?
- What is the average profit margin across product types?

---

## Why This Project Stands Out

- 100% of the working is visible — nothing is hidden  
- Demonstrates real-life analyst thinking  
- Uses the most common tools in analyst job roles (Excel + SQL)  
- Easy to reuse for dashboards (Power BI, Tableau, etc.)
